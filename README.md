## Oracle PL/SQL API for [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com) ##

**Validate email addresses and send emails with pure PL/SQL.**

The API provides methods to:
  
  * **validate an email address** - does the same thing as the [jQuery-based APEX plugin](http://jeffreykemp.github.io/jk64-plugin-mailgunemailvalidator/), except from the server
  
  * **send an email**
    > *NOTE: another alternative (one that also works with Oracle APEX's builtin email system) is to use the mailgun SMTP interface instead.*

  * query your mailgun usage and failure **statistics** and events log

  * manage your mailgun **bounces, unsubscribes and complaints** lists
