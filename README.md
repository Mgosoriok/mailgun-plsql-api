# mailgun-plsql-api
**Oracle PL/SQL API for [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com)**

Validate email addresses and send emails with pure PL/SQL.

It includes:
  
  * email validator - does the same thing as the [jQuery-based Apex plugin](https://github.com/jeffreykemp/jk64-plugin-mailgunemailvalidator), except from the server
  
  * API call to send an email

    *NOTE: another alternative (one that also works with Apex's builtin emails is to use the mailgun SMTP interface instead.*

For installation instructions and references, refer to the [WIKI](https://github.com/jeffreykemp/mailgun-plsql-api/wiki).
