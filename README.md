# mailgun-plsql-api: Oracle PL/SQL API for [Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com) ##

**Validate email addresses and send emails with pure PL/SQL.**

> *Warning: use the [Latest Release](https://github.com/jeffreykemp/mailgun-plsql-api/releases/latest) - don't use the "Download Zip" option on the home page (may contain unfinished work).*

The API provides methods to:
  
  * **validate an email address** - does the same thing as the [jQuery-based Apex plugin](https://github.com/jeffreykemp/jk64-plugin-mailgunemailvalidator), except from the server
  
  * **send an email**
    > *NOTE: another alternative (one that also works with Apex's builtin emails is to use the mailgun SMTP interface instead.*

  * query your mailgun usage and failure **statistics**

  * *(more planned)*

For installation instructions, detailed API references and example code, refer to the **[WIKI](https://github.com/jeffreykemp/mailgun-plsql-api/wiki)**.
